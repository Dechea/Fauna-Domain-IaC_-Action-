# Fauna-IaC

This Action simplifies the use of [fauna-schema-migrate](https://github.com/fauna-labs/fauna-schema-migrate).
It can be used to deploy a mono repo to Fauna,
or it can be used to follow a Domain Driven approach with multiple repositories getting deployed to one database.

Manages 
- Graphql schema,
- UDFs, 
- Indexes, 
- Roles, 
- Collections 
- Access providers 
in GitHub and deploys it afterwards to Fauna.

## YAML Definition

## Prerequisites
  
Depending if you're following a Mono or Domain Driven repository approach, follow the corresponding prerequisite paths.
  
**Mono Repo:** 
One repo - one database (Traditional approach)
  
**Domain driven repositories:** 
You will run all business logic in one databases, so that you have the full performance power of Fauna and every team has everytime a fully working database with all domains (Theoratically no need anymore for a staging environment). But every team has an own repository with their own responsibility, so your teams can develop and ship features independently. Trying to get the best of both worlds - autonomy and performance.
  
### Mono Repository

#### 1. Follow the steps from [fauna-schema-migrate](https://github.com/fauna-labs/fauna-schema-migrate) 
#### 2. Create a PAT (Personal access token)
The PAT must have read & write access to the repositories. In the case of private repositories you'll want to create a machine user, add the machine user to the repositories that you want to checkout and then generate a token for the machine user.
  
### Domain Driven Repository  

#### 1. Create in Fauna the domain relevant databases.

- One database for production
- One child database for staging (Optional)
- One child database for each domain e.g. Dev_User, Dev_Invoice

We have structured our databases in Fauna that way:

<ul>
  <li>ProductName</li>
  <ul>
    <li>Production</li>
    <li>Staging</li>
    <li>Domains</li>
    <ul>
      <li>USR_User</li>
      <li>INV_Invoice</li>
    </ul> 
  </ul> 
</ul>  

#### 2. Create for every domain one repository in GitHub

Example:

- Repo 1: USR_User
- Repo 2: INV_Invoice

#### 3. Follow the prefix naming pattern for all ressources

To achieve, that multiple teams can publish to one database, we have to follow a naming pattern to avoid merge conflicts because of duplicated collections, UDFs etc.
We're working with a unique prefix for every domain e.g. USR for User or INV for Invoice and so on.
This pattern needs to be applied as a prefix to your ressources and divided by a "_" from the rest of the name:

- Collections (e.g. "USR_Address" or "USR_SomethingElse")
- Indexes (e.g. "USR_GetAddressByUserId" or "USR_SomethingElse")
- Roles (e.g. "USR_GetAddressByUserId" or "USR_SomethingElse")
- UDFs (e.g. "USR_Administrator" or "USR_SomethingElse")
- Graphql schemas (e.g. "USR_Schema" or "USR_SomethingElse")
- Repository name (e.g. "USR_Schema" or "USR_SomethingElse") (Optional)
- Fauna domain databases (e.g. "USR_User" or "USR_SomethingElse") (Optional)

Good to know: If you follow these pattern, it's also relatively easy to have a code coverage report for every domain independently. You can do a code coverage inclusion in every repo for the files that are starting with the prefix of your own domain and then publish it e.g. to Sonarcloud.
  
#### 4. Create a PAT (Personal access token)
The PAT must have read & write access to the repositories. In the case of private repositories you'll want to create a machine user, add the machine user to the repositories that you want to checkout and then generate a token for the machine user.

## How it works
We have repositories created for every domain. Every repo has the structure defined by [fauna-schema-migrate](https://github.com/fauna-labs/fauna-schema-migrate). It includes collections, UDFs, Indexes, roles that are related to that domain. 
But we're using only one database. So one repo can't apply simply their infrastructure to the database. Instead we have to assemble it first with all other domain repos, run the tests and then apply it to the database. This is what this Action does.
<br />
For that we using the data provided in the "GITHUB_REPOSITORIES" variable. We clone the repositories, merge it, apply it to the given FAUNA_DATABASE and run all the tests.
<br /><br />

## TBD  

- Bring support for multiple test runners (Jest, AVA, Mocha etc.)
- Automatically code coverage upload to Sonarcloud, codecov etc.
- Run test in parallel
- Apply migration to multiple databases at once  
  
## Q&A

### 1. What happens if one domain introduce a breaking change?
Currently the whole Action would fail, because we run all tests from all Domains. Only if all tests passing, the changes will be applied to production.
